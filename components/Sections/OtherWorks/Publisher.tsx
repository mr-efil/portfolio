              In this project, we&apos;ve created a mobile app designed for
              managing a database system. The app caters to three distinct user
              roles: Admins, Editors, and Teachers.
              <br />
              Teachers are responsible for creating questions, which are then
              sent to Editors for refinement, including tasks like adding
              images, arranging fonts, etc. Once the edits are completed, the
              questions are sent back to the Teachers for approval. This
              back-and-forth process between Editors and Teachers continues
              until both parties are satisfied with the question&apos;s quality.
              <br />
              Subsequently, the approved questions are forwarded to the Admin
              for final approval. Upon receiving Admin approval, the questions
              are stored in the main database.
